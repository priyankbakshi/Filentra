**Subject:** CBAM: missing Q2 data could cost €>100k — quick fix inside

Hi {first_name},

> **TL;DR**: EU CBAM’s next quarterly window opens in 4 weeks.  
> If {company} ships steel/aluminium without the XML & fallback audit fields,
> fines stack at **€50 / tonne / day**.

I built **Filentra CBAM Express Fix** after watching importers lose
weeks wrangling Eurostat codes, NACE mismatches and ZIP-schema errors.
We patch the XML, auto-generate the fallback memo and push the filing
—in < 48 h.
